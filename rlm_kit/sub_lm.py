"""Phase A — ``intercept_sub_lm``: the one hook to intercept the RLM's sub-LM.

``dspy.RLM`` exposes no hook to intercept a sub-LLM response before it returns to
the main model — and its built-in ``llm_query`` / ``llm_query_batched`` tools just
call ``self.sub_lm(prompt)``. So the ONLY interception point is the sub_lm object
itself. ``intercept_sub_lm`` wraps a ``dspy.LM``: ``RLM`` only sees "a sub_lm", but
inside we emit a ``sub_call`` trace event for every escalation and (optionally) run
a deterministic pipeline — call the base model, validate the format, post-process.
Tracing is the always-on job; validators/postprocessors are opt-in.

Design decisions baked in (per the approved plan):

- The sub-LM intercept does **deterministic transforms only** (validate + post-process).
  Agentic actions (calling an external tool) are *not* forced here; they are
  exposed to the main LM as RLM tools (see ``model_as_tool`` and
  ``rlm_kit.skills``), so the decision stays in the LM's hands and lands in the
  trajectory.
- Multi-model routing is done today via ``model_as_tool`` (LM-decided), not the
  unmerged official ``sub_lms`` API. When ``sub_lms`` ships, swap it in without
  touching task code.

``dspy`` is imported lazily so this module stays importable (and the pipeline
logic stays unit-testable) without a full dspy install.

    sits in that ``sub_lm`` slot. On every call it records a ``sub_call`` trace event
    (the escalation's input + the sub-LM's raw/processed output) — that is the
