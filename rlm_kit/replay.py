"""Phase C (part 1) — reconstruct and replay a recorded run.

Replay reads the JSONL trace and rebuilds an ordered timeline. For deterministic
replay it serves *recorded* tool outputs rather than re-executing tools (which
may be non-deterministic or have side effects). This makes a past run inspectable
and step-through-able without touching the outside world.

Pure stdlib; no dspy import.
