"""Phase B — unified, replayable trajectory recording.

Two sources must be merged to get a complete picture of an RLM-as-harness run:

1. The main LM's REPL trajectory, which ``dspy.RLM`` already returns on the
   ``Prediction`` object as ``trajectory`` (a list of ``{reasoning, code,
   output}`` dicts, verified against dspy 3.2.1) plus ``final_reasoning``.
2. The intercepted sub-LM pipeline and any LM-decided tool calls — which live
   *inside* the intercepted ``sub_lm`` / tool wrappers and are therefore invisible
   to the RLM trajectory. These are exactly the steps most valuable for Agentic RL.

``TraceRecorder`` collects both into a single append-only JSONL event stream,
keyed by ``run_id`` + a monotonically increasing ``step_id``. The active recorder
is published via a ``contextvar`` so the intercepted ``sub_lm`` and tools find it without
threading it through every call. An optional Langfuse sink mirrors events for
observability; the JSONL is the source of truth for the RL dataset (it must not
depend on Langfuse's export format).

This module is dependency-light: stdlib ``json`` only. No dspy import.
