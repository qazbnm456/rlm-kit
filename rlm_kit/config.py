"""Single source of truth for RLM runtime configuration.

Everything the scaffold needs to stand up a Recursive Language Model — model
names, credentials, the sandbox interpreter, budget caps, retry policy — lives
here and is driven by environment variables. No other module reads ``os.environ``.

This module intentionally has **no** ``dspy`` import so it stays trivially
importable and unit-testable.

# How the RLM coaxes structured output fields out of the model.
#   "json"    — DEFAULT. Schema-guided structured output: a brace-tolerant JSONAdapter
#               (runtime._LenientJSONAdapter) forces the ``json_schema`` response_format and
#               absorbs guided output. Works on ANY endpoint that supports structured output
#               — OpenAI-proper AND vLLM/NIM (which reject schema-less json_object but
#               accept json_schema). On a constraint-decoding server the decoder enforces
#               the schema, so even a weak / imperfectly-formatting model emits valid output.
#   "chat"    — dspy.ChatAdapter with the JSONAdapter fallback DISABLED: text field-markers
#               only, never sends ``response_format``. For an endpoint that supports NO
#               structured output at all. The model must follow the markers reliably — a
#               weak model that drops a field has NO recovery (dspy's own ChatAdapter would
#               fall back to bare json_object, which the kit turns off because vLLM rejects
#               it; so we don't get that recovery either). Not as portable as it looks.
#   "default" — impose nothing; leave dspy's stock adapter (ChatAdapter WITH the json
#               fallback) in place. Recovers via json_object on OpenAI-proper endpoints,
#               but that fallback is rejected by vLLM/NIM.

        Recognised variables (all optional except where a sane default is shown):

        - ``RLM_MAIN_MODEL`` / ``AI_MODEL_NAME`` (default ``openai/gpt-4o``) — the
          REPL/root model. An INSTRUCT or a REASONING model both work: ``_LenientJSONAdapter``
          promotes ``reasoning_content`` to the answer when a reasoning root leaves ``content``
          empty (some emit the whole structured turn into the thinking channel). Caveats for a
          reasoning root: its native chain-of-thought is still DISCARDED (dspy reads only the
          structured turn), so it spends tokens the trace won't keep, and a too-small ``max_tokens``
          can truncate it mid-thought (→ empty content) — keep the cap generous (see ``max_tokens``).
          The second var is a fallback so this scaffold drops into projects that already use
          ``AI_MODEL_NAME`` without re-keying env.
        - ``RLM_SUB_MODEL`` / ``SUB_AI_MODEL_NAME`` (default: same as main) —
          model for recursive subcalls.
        - ``RLM_API_KEY`` / ``AI_API_KEY`` — API key (the second is a fallback so
          this scaffold can drop into projects that already use ``AI_API_KEY``).
        - ``RLM_BASE_URL`` / ``AI_BASE_URL`` — optional custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
          When set, ``configure`` pins ``custom_llm_provider="openai"`` so the model names
          above can be the PLAIN id the endpoint serves (e.g. ``qwen/qwen3-next``) — no
          ``openai/`` (or other litellm provider) prefix needed; a prefixed name still works.
          With no base_url, write the model's own provider prefix (``openai/gpt-4o``,
          ``anthropic/claude-...``) as litellm expects.
        - ``RLM_INTERPRETER`` (default ``pyodide``).
        - ``RLM_ADAPTER`` (default ``json``) — ``chat`` | ``json`` | ``default``;
          see ``KNOWN_ADAPTERS``. ``json`` (schema-guided) works on any endpoint that
          supports structured output; ``chat`` is for endpoints that support none.
        - ``RLM_MAX_TOKENS`` (default ``8192``) — per-call generation cap for the LM;
          generous by default so a reasoning model's chain-of-thought + answer both fit
          instead of hitting a server's small default cap (which truncates → empty content).
