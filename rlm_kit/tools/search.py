"""Provider-agnostic ``web_search`` building blocks (mirrors ``fetch.py``).

A search tool needs two halves: the PROVIDER (an HTTP call to DuckDuckGo / Tavily /
TinyFish / … plus its API key) and the generic GUARD/NORMALISE step. rlm-kit owns only
the generic half — it picks NO provider. The consuming project supplies a ``searcher``
(``query -> raw results``) and rlm-kit turns the raw results into a safe, capped,
uniform ``[{"title","url","snippet"}]`` list.

Two entry points, matching ``fetch.py``'s ``is_safe_url`` (primitive) + ``make_fetch_tool``
(factory):

- ``normalise_search_results`` — the reusable primitive. Sync, dependency-free. Use it
  inside your own tool, exactly as the fetch tool reuses ``is_safe_url``.
- ``make_web_search_tool`` — a SYNC factory that builds the whole tool for you (parallel to
  ``make_fetch_tool``), ready to hand to ``RLMTask(tools=…)``. Sync because dspy.RLM invokes
  tools synchronously; an async tool there never runs.

Search results are URLs the agent will then fetch, so ``is_safe_url`` is reused here to
drop internal-looking result URLs before they reach the model.
