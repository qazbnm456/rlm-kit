"""Provider-agnostic ``make_model_tool`` — the generic "model-backed tool + validate"
core (mirrors ``fetch.py`` / ``search.py``).

A model-as-tool — a SECONDARY model the RLM root calls as a tool to PRODUCE something
(YAML, code, SQL, …) which is then deterministically validated — is a recurring shape.
The reusable mechanics are: call the model, retry only *transient* endpoint errors,
capture the answer + any thinking-mode reasoning, then run a validator on the output.

rlm-kit owns ONLY that generic core. The consuming project supplies the ``chat_fn`` (its
endpoint/model/prompt), a ``validate`` callable (its domain validator), and — around the
returned ``ModelToolResult`` — its own tool name, result-message wording, and tracing
(exactly as the fetch / web_search consumers wrap their bases). The factory returns a
``call(spec) -> ModelToolResult``; it does NOT format strings or record traces.

    """Build the generic call: chat (retrying transient errors) → validate → ModelToolResult.

    ``transient_retries`` retries ONLY exceptions from ``chat_fn`` (endpoint flakiness); a
    validator that returns ``ok=False`` is NOT retried (that is the caller's repair loop, e.g.
    re-spec and call again). On exhausted retries the result has ``endpoint_error`` set and
    ``ok=False``.

    ``max_consecutive_invalid`` (default ``None`` = off) is a run-scoped CIRCUIT BREAKER: once the
    validator has returned ``ok=False`` that many times in a ROW, the next call SHORT-CIRCUITS —
    it does NOT invoke the model and returns ``circuit_broken=True`` (``ok=False``, empty ``raw``).
    A productive repair loop recovers within a couple of declines, so a long unbroken decline run
    means the model cannot satisfy specs of this shape; short-circuiting caps wasted model calls and
    lets the caller redirect the root LM (escalate / finalize) instead of letting it thrash. The
    counter RESETS on any validator-``ok``; an endpoint error does NOT count (it is infra, not a
    content decline). This factory only FLAGS the break — the caller owns the user-facing message,
    same split as the rest. The factory is sync and side-effect-free (no tracing, no message
    templating) — wrap the result in your project's tool with its own name/messages/tracing.

    The breaker state lives in this closure, so build ONE tool per run (as the consumers do) and it
    resets naturally for the next run.
