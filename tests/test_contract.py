"""Contract test — PIN the cross-project surface a consumer builds on, so a change that would
silently break a downstream reader (a consumer's report renderer + RL export, a trajectory-replay
UI, a future RL trainer) fails HERE, in rlm-kit's own suite, instead of in the consumer with no
clue why.

Three frozen things (see CLAUDE.md "The trace is a VERSIONED wire format"):
  1. the trace SCHEMA + the seven EVENT_* type strings,
  2. the recorded-event ENVELOPE shape,
  3. the dataset-exporter RECORD shapes (export_actions / export_sft_turns / export_rl),
plus the public ``__all__`` surface a consumer imports. ADDITIVE change is fine (a new optional
payload field, a new ``__all__`` entry); removing / renaming / re-typing any of these is a v1 break —
bump SCHEMA to ``rlm-kit/trace/v2`` with a migration instead of editing this test to be green.
